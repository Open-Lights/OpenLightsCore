# OpenLightsCore - Open Source Music and Lighting Controller Software

This is the Rust equivalent of my [Java Christmas Jukebox](https://github.com/QPCrummer/Christmas-Jukebox).
It utilizes the [Open Lights Editor](https://github.com/QPCrummer/BeatMaker) to create Beat Files that are read by Open Lights Core.
This project aims to be much more resource efficient than my previous attempt, while also being thread safe.

Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/QPCrummer/OpenLightsCore/wiki) for more information!

How to run:
`run --package open_lights_core --bin open_lights_core`
