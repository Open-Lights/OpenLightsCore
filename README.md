# OpenLightsCore - Open Source Music and Lighting Controller Software

This is a very WIP project based on my Java Christmas Jukebox.
This project aims to be much more resource efficient than my previous attempt, while also being thread safe and web-based.

How to run:
`run --package open_lights_core --bin open_lights_core`
